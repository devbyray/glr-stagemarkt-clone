# Commit Message Conventions

Writing clear and consistent commit messages is essential for maintaining an understandable and traceable code history. Follow the **Conventional Commits** format.

## Commit Message Structure

```
<type>[scope]: <short description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

### Components

**`<type>`** (required) - The type of change:

- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code formatting without functional changes
- `refactor`: Code improvements without new features
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks (dependency updates, config changes)
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `ci`: CI/CD configuration changes
- `build`: Build system or dependency changes

**`[scope]`** (optional) - The component, module, or section affected:

- Examples: `(auth)`, `(api)`, `(ui)`, `(header)`, `(footer)`

**`<short description>`** (required) - Brief description of the change:

- Max 50-72 characters
- Use present tense
- Lowercase start (after type)
- No period at the end

**`[body]`** (optional) - Detailed explanation:

- Wrap at 72 characters
- Explain what and why, not how
- Separate from description with blank line

**`[footer]`** (optional) - Breaking changes or issue references:

- `BREAKING CHANGE:` for breaking changes
- Issue references: `Closes #123`, `Fixes #456`

## Commit Message Rules

1. **Concise and specific**: Keep description under 72 characters
2. **Present tense**: Use "Add" not "Added", "Fix" not "Fixed"
3. **No period**: Don't end the description with a period
4. **Imperative mood**: Write as if giving a command
5. **Clear scope**: Use scope to indicate what part of the codebase changed

## Examples

### New Feature

```
feat(header): add dropdown menu to navbar
```

### Bug Fix

```
fix(api): resolve error when fetching user data
```

### Documentation

```
docs(readme): add installation instructions
```

### Code Refactor

```
refactor(utils): restructure formatting logic
```

### Tests

```
test(auth): add tests for password recovery
```

### Maintenance

```
chore(dependencies): update axios to v1.3.0
```

### Performance

```
perf(images): optimize image loading with lazy loading
```

### Breaking Change

```
feat(api): change authentication endpoint structure

BREAKING CHANGE: The /auth endpoint now returns a different response structure.
Clients must update to handle the new format.
```

### With Issue Reference

```
fix(login): prevent memory leak on logout

The logout function was not properly cleaning up event listeners,
causing a memory leak after repeated login/logout cycles.

Fixes #234
```

### Multiple Scopes

```
feat(api, ui): add user profile avatar upload
```

## Bad Examples (Don't Do This)

❌ `Fixed bug` - Too vague, missing type and scope
❌ `feat: Added new feature.` - Has period, past tense
❌ `update readme` - Missing type
❌ `feat(API): Add Feature` - Uppercase scope and description
❌ `WIP commit` - Not descriptive, use proper type

## Good Examples (Do This)

✅ `feat(auth): add two-factor authentication`
✅ `fix(cart): resolve total calculation error`
✅ `docs(api): update endpoint documentation`
✅ `refactor(user-service): simplify user validation logic`
✅ `test(checkout): add integration tests for payment flow`

## Commit Frequency

- Commit early and often
- Each commit should be a logical unit of work
- Commits should not break the build
- Group related changes together

## When to Apply

Apply these conventions when:

- Making any git commit
- Creating pull requests
- Reviewing commit history
- Setting up git hooks
- Generating changelogs
- User asks about commit standards

## Tools

Consider using these tools to enforce commit conventions:

- **commitlint**: Lint commit messages
- **husky**: Git hooks for validation
- **commitizen**: Interactive commit message builder
- **standard-version**: Automated versioning and changelog
